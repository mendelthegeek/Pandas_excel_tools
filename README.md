# Pandas_excel_tools
Some tools written in python that help fill in some gaps which excel doesn't have a function for.

# Add_Separate_sheets
The add_separate_sheets tool is a GUI which allows a user to add entries lying in a single excel file, but on separate sheets. The program prompts a user to pick a file by browsing, and then lets them input which cells they want added up. After computing the average and sum of the selected cells, the program allows a user to download a .csv file with the obtained result.

Here is what the program looks like when run:
